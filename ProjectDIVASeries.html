                <h4 style="text-align: left; margin-left: 5%">Introduction:</h4>
                <p style="text-align: left; margin-left: 5%">
                    Welcome to Hatsune Miku – PROJECT DIVA ƒ! The incredibly popular Vocaloid Hatsune Miku
                    herself has come to both the Playstation Vita and Playstation 3 along with the twins Kagamine
                    Rin and Len, Luka, MEIKO and KAITO for another rhythm game adventure! There are 32 songs for
                    you to enjoy in this game (however lucky Playstation 3 players gain access to an extra six
                    brand new songs) with four difficulties available to choose from. There are online capabilities
                    within the game as well, including the opportunity to edit your own songs which you can upload
                    for the world to see, buy dozens of accessories and Modules for all six characters as well as
                    caring for your Vocaloids in their own DIVA Rooms!
                    <br>
                    <br>The trophies in Hatsune Miku – PROJECT DIVA ƒ are thankfully much easier than their Dreamy
                    Theater, Dreamy Theater 2 and Dreamy Theater Extend counterparts, which range from 9 to 10 on
                    the trophy difficulty scale. All that's required in this in a nutshell is to complete the game
                    on two difficulties, Normal and Hard (no Perfecting required at all – phew!), reaching max
                    friendship level with all six characters, as well as purchasing all available Modules (outfits)
                    for the characters. Even though it is easy in retrospect, it will require quite a bit of time
                    investment as well as a grind for Diva Points so don't be expecting a quick here. There's
                    something to note that's rather important in the game; most trophies will unlock when you back
                    out to the main menu screen. So if it doesn't unlock immediately, do not fret. Simply back out
                    a couple of menus and if you see the game saving when you back out, you'll more than likely
                    earn the trophy.

                    Want to import this game to enjoy some of your favourite Vocaloid songs but afraid your lack of
                    knowledge in the Japanese language will hold you back? Do not fear, it is still very easy to
                    navigate and unless you want to understand the lyrics of the songs, you will not need to know a
                    single word of the Japanese to enjoy, finish and subsequently this game. If you are already
                    studying Japanese then knowing Katakana will definitely help as the game makes use of this
                    alphabet quite a bit, but otherwise you will simply need to follow the instructions within the
                    guide.

                        The next installment to the increasingly popular Vocaloid console rhythm game franchise is
                        <br>here! Hatsune Miku – PROJECT DIVA ƒ 2nd packs 40 songs into the roster, with new
                        favourites
                        <br>such as DECORATOR and Envy Catwalk to returning classics like World is Mine and Melt.
                        New
                        <br>in-game features, gorgeous anime graphics and the returning DIVA Rooms gives you a lot
                        to enjoy
                        <br>in this new rhythm game for music, Vocaloid and anime fans alike. The game may be just
                        a little
                        <br>harder than the original DIVA ƒ with the likes of The Intense Singing of Hatsune Miku
                        and
                        <br>Two-Faced Lovers, both infamously difficult songs in the previous Project DIVA games
                        which
                        <br>never reached western shores, but should ultimately provide a good challenge for
                        players.

                        <br>The trophy list in this game is very much like the first Project Diva ƒ; unfortunately
                        leaving
                        <br>little challenge for veterans of rhythm however for the majority this is a relief as
                        the will
                        <br>be reachable for gamers of all skill levels. However, you'll again be grinding out
                        DIVA Points
                        <br>to purchase not only all Modules (outfits) and DIVA Room furniture, but also
                        miscellaneous
                        <br>items on sale such as Skins, customise items and presents. Therefore, the grind is
                        <br>substantially longer than the previous game. One or two trophies also may prove
                        difficult to
                        <br>some players, such as 3030メートル [Call it Macaroni] which requires you to win a
                        mini-game in the
                        <br>DIVA Rooms, which activates randomly.

                        <br>-Much like the first Project DIVA ƒ, the Japanese language is simple to get by in this
                        game.
                        <br>-However, considering the game recommends modules for you to use in their respective
                        songs (and
                        <br>-is a necessity to unlocking some Skins, which is required for a trophy) you may have
                        trouble
                        <br>-knowing which outfit goes with which song. Furthermore, there is a list of unlockables
                        holding
                        <br>-specific requirements for each song, and due to the complexity of this, translated
                        lists for
                        <br>-both of these are available at the end of the guide.

                        to the West, and the first (well, second counting an arcade port) on the Playstation 4.

                        Here is some important information on game mechanics that will help as you work towards the

                        <br>-Voltage: Voltage is your score in this version when playing Requests. Your Voltage Rate shows the multiplier applied to the score for each note you hit. You will need to clear a specific Voltage Order to pass each Request, and the maximum Voltage without any modifiers is 100,000 for hitting all COOLs plus hold/rush notes.

                        <br>Modifiers to Voltage Rate are as follows:

                        <br>Have an Accessory that matches the Aura Bonus: +5% per Accessory

                        <br><br>Combination Bonuses: If you equip a specific set of Accessories, you will get a bonus to the starting Voltage Rate of the song, and thus a score multiplier. The best bonuses for each Aura are as follows (each provide +20%):
                        <br> Classic: Control Headset + Cyber Visor + Equalizer + Speakers
                        <br>Cute: Flower Crown + Flower Glasses + Flower Necklace + Flower Petal Wings
                        <br>Cool: Devil’s Head Wings + Skull Eyepatch + Chain Necklace + Fallen Angel Wings
                        <br>Elegant: Gemmed Hair Clips + Face Veil + Fancy Necklace + Gemmed Cape
                        <br>Quirky: Feathered Cap + Four-Leaf Clover + Ocarina + Traveler’s Instrument
                        <br>See Seibei4211's post for a complete list of all combination bonuses.
                        <br><br>Modules: There are 294 total Modules in the game: 112 for Miku, 41 for Rin, 37 for Len, 40 for Luka, 32 for KAITO and 32 for MEIKO. You get a module every time you successfully complete Chance Time and will keep it if you clear the Voltage Order for the song. To help with acquiring new modules, equip a module with New Module Dropper (you can get up to Level 4). In addition, when completing a Festival, only the third Vocaloid you choose will get a Chance Time, and thus they are the only one you can earn a Module for. See Event Organizer for more details.
                        <br><br>Gifts: When clearing a Request, you will get a number of Accessories or Gift items depending on how well you do in the song. If the Voltage Gauge turns rainbow, you have earned the maximum number of items for that song. The maximum number of rewards you can earn depends on the difficulty: 2 for Easy, 3 for Normal, 4 for Hard and 5 for Extreme. You can only hold a maximum of 5 of each Gift item, so use them when you're getting close to limit the amount of grinding you need to do later. See Gift Giver Galore for more details.
                        <br><br>Gift Events: Every 5 songs you play, you will get a Gift Event (you can tell you'll get one if the Retry button is greyed out). Successfully complete the Vocaloid's request to earn a large Friendship bump. See Miku's BFF for more details.
